# html-to-exe
Hewo dear hoomans (ugh, im gonna die!), I am tired, I lack motivation, overall...I'm low on vibes yo (ðŸ¤¢, kill me!).
I present to you, the worlds worst html wrapper for an exe!
## what do you use this piece of garbage for?
We can use it to make http dependent apps work using SimpleHTTP server (an in-built python module with python 3, i think).
Usually you can run it using terminal by typing: "your/html/directory> python -m http.server". 
But now, you dont have to do any of that!
Just run the program, 
- At first, test.htm will be the one loading, well, you can fix that by,
- Opening up the config.yml file and changing the "file-to-load" setting to a path of your liking!
- Please make sure to put the html file inside the directory in which the "HTML-TO-EXE.exe" is placed! (If you mess it up...too bad!)
## please leave me alone
I will update this if I want to. I am not very interested in this project anyways!
# GOOD BYE!
